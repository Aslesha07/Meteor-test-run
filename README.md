#Meteor CRUD

A basic [Meteor](http://meteor.com) app used for teaching Meteor basics.

## Step 0: Create app/Basic app structure
- To follow along with instruction, run ```git clone git@github.com:andersr/meteor_crud``` from your terminal and cd into "meteor crud"
- Open the current directory in a text editor
- Cd into the "app" directory and run ```meteor``` from the command line. 
- (If you were creating this app from scratch, you would simply have typed ```meteor create app``` in this directory.)
- Leave this window/tab open and open a new tab in the same directory to use for future terminal commands.
- Open a browser window and enter the URL: "http://localhost:3000"
- Leave this window open while building the app.  Meteor will auto-refresh as you make changes.
- Why have your app in an "app" sub-directory? Having your app as sub-directory of your working app directory allows for making external files, such as config files, build files, task runners, etc, be part of the app, without being mixed in with the actual app files.
